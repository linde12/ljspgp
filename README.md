# ljspgp

Learning from RFC4880 and, when needed, looking at examples & borrowing
implementations(to try things out quickly) from openpgpjs.

The goal with this project is to learn about RFC4880 and implementing a basic, but working, PGP tool. Encryption, decryption & signing should work. Everything should be base64 encoded and armored so the user can export it as utf8.
